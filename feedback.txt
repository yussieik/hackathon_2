Hey Akiva,

Just had a look at your Django project. Here's some feedback for you:

- Your project structure and file organization are commendable. However, it's not quite ideal to mix the API app with a regular (not REST API) app in the same directory. Consider separating them into different directories. This will make your project more modular and easier to maintain in the future.

- Your code readability and formatting are on point. You seem to have a good grip on the PEP 8 standards which makes your code easy to navigate.

- Impressive usage of Django and Django REST Framework features! The fact that you're creating template tags caught my attention. Also, your serializer is nice and compact.

- As for the database modeling, it's almost there. Your `Word` model is quite straightforward, but don't forget about validations. They'll help to ensure your data is accurate and consistent.

- Views and URL design are well structured and logical. Great work there!

- Your project could benefit from some additional error handling. Implementing try-except clauses where applicable will help your application to be more robust and user-friendly.

- There's room for improvement in your documentation. It's not only about commenting your code but also about providing a clear and comprehensive overview of your project, including setup and usage instructions.

- Lastly, remember to exclude sensitive files like `.env` from your Git repository. This is a common security best practice that you should stick to.

In a nutshell, you've done a solid job so far. Keep refining your project, paying attention to these areas of feedback. Keep up the good work!

Best,
Yossi.
